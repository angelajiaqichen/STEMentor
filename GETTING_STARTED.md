```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your API keys (OpenAI, etc.)
nano .env
```

### 3. Start with Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 4. Manual Development Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup-dev.sh
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Start backend
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Start frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm start
```

## 🔧 Available Services

Once running, you can access:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8001
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8001/docs
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432
- **Redis**: localhost:6379
- **ChromaDB**: localhost:8000

```

## 📖 Architecture Details

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **RESTful API** with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Async/await** for high performance
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** with async support
- **Pydantic** for data validation
- **Celery** for background document processing
- **LangChain** for AI integration

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Modern React 18** with hooks and context
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Axios** for API communication

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL** for relational data
- **Redis** for caching and sessions
- **ChromaDB** for vector embeddings
- **Optimized indexes** for performance

## 🤝 Contributing

The codebase is well-structured for adding new features:

1. Add new API endpoints in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`
2. Create new database models in `backend/app/models/`
3. Add frontend pages in `frontend/src/pages/`
4. Extend services in `backend/app/services/`

## 💡 Tips

- Use the API documentation at `/docs` for testing endpoints
- Monitor logs with `docker-compose logs -f [service_name]`
- The database is persistent between restarts
- All services auto-reload during development
